# XR_for_VisNow

## 🧠 Scientific XR Visualization Prototype

### Overview

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept implementation** for integrating **VisNow**, a modular scientific visualization platform, with **XR environments** (Mixed Reality) using **Unity** and **Meta Quest 3**.

The project enables:

* Importing and rendering those models in a **spatial XR scene**
* Basic interactions such as viewing and rotating 3D scientific data in real-world scale

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Unity** (XR Interaction Toolkit, URP)
* **Meta XR SDK** (hand tracking, passthrough, spatial anchors)
* Language: **C# (Unity)**

### 🚀 Features

* Import and display of OBJ 3D models exported from VisNow
* Support for spatial placement and manipulation (rotate, move)
* Mixed reality passthrough visualization (Meta Quest 3)
* Hand-tracking and controller-based interaction

### 🧪 Status

This is an early-stage prototype intended to demonstrate **basic feasibility** of integrating VisNow with consumer XR devices (Meta Quest 3). More advanced features (e.g., real-time data sync, voice assistant, advanced volumetric rendering) are planned for future development.

### ⚙️ Requirements

* Unity 6000.1.6f1
* Meta Quest 3 / 3S
* VisNow
* Meta Quest Link / Steam Link
